# Spatial Resolution

We have discussed pixel resolution. Now, let's study spatial resolution.

Spatial resolution states that the number of pixels in an image does not matter.

It is defined as **the number of independent pixels values per inch**.

In spatial resolution, we cannot compare clarity of two images of different sizes. We have to compare the clarity of same size images.

Compare two images which are same size.
1st picture has more spatial resolutin than 2nd one.

Spatial resolution refers to clarity that different devices measure it differnetly.
- Dots per inch (mostly in monitor)
- Lines per inch (mostly in laser printer)
- Pixels per inch (Tablets, mobile phone etc)

## Pixels per inch (Pixel density)

It is a measure of spatial resolutin in devices like mobile phones and tablets.
The higher the pixel density, the higher the quality.

### Calculating PPI

Consider a device, a mobile phone has 1080 x 1920 pixels. **(cols * rows) *or* (width * height)**

Diagonal resolution in pixel is calculated in Pythagora's theorem.
```js
Diagonal Resolution = Sqrt( width^2 + height^2 )
```

Thus Diagonal Resolution is 2202.90717 pixels;

To get PPI, divide diagonal resolution by diagonal size in inches.
```js
pixels per inch = Diagonal Resolution/diagonal size in inches
```
Suppose device has 5 inches diagonal size. So, **PPI** is 440.58 ~ 441.

Therefore, pixel density of this device is 441 PPI.

# Zooming

There are three common zooming methods.
- Pixel replication or (Nearest neighbor interpolation)
- Zero order hold method
- Zooming K times

## Pixel replication

Other name - Nearest neighbor interpolation

This method is to replicate the neighboring pixels. 
Suppose you want 2 times zooming an image of 2 rows and 2 cols.
It can be done in 2 steps : row-wise or col-wise.

### Row-wise

Suppose in matrix.
|       |       |
|-------|-------|
| 1     | 2     |
| 3     | 4     |
|       |       |

To zoom 2 times in row-wise, replicate each row-pixel to its adjacent cell.

That means each pixel in a row is replicate twice. 
|       |       |      |       |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| 1     | 1     |2     | 2     |
| 3     | 3     |4     | 4     |
|       |       |      |       |

### **Next Step** : Col-wise

Each pixel in a column is replicated.
|       |       |      |       |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| 1     | 1     |2     | 2     |
| 3     | 3     |4     | 4     |
|       |       |      |       |

to

|       |       |      |       |
|-------|-------|------|-------|
| 1     | 1     |2     | 2     |
| 1     | 1     |2     | 2     |
| 3     | 3     |4     | 4     |
| 3     | 3     |4     | 4     |
|       |       |      |       |

New Image size will be increased. 2x2 image is now converted into 4x4 image.
```js
[newCols,newRows] = [ (cols * zoomFactor),(rows * zoomFactor) ]
```
**Pros**

The method is so simple

**Cons**

As zooming factor increases, the image will get more blurry.

## Zero order hold

It is another method of zooming, also known as zooming twice.
Because it can only zoom twice.

### How it works

First, we take two adjacent pixels from a row and add them. Divide the result by 2. Put the output as a new pixel between the original adjacent pixels. We do row-wise first and then col-wise.

Suppose in matrix.
|       |       |
|-------|-------|
| 1     | 2     |
| 3     | 4     |
|       |       |

First row-wise. Add 1 & 2. Divide result by 2, which is 1.5. Then, take nearby value approximately as 1. Put 1 between 1 & 2. So does second row.

|       |       |      |       
|-------|-------|------|
| 1     | 1     |2     |
| 3     | 3     |4     | 
|       |       |      |  

Then col-wise. Take 1 & 3, and add and divide by 2 is 2.
Put 2 between 1 & 3.

|       |       |      |       
|-------|-------|------|
| 1     | 1     |2     |
| 2     | 2     |3     |
| 3     | 3     |4     | 
|       |       |      |  
```js
[newCols,newRows] = [(cols * 2)-1,(rows * 2)-1]
```
**Pros**

It does not create as blurry image as Pixel replication.

**Cons**

It can only zoom 2 times & 2 power times. 
Here, 2x2 is zoomed into 3x3. 3x3 will be into 5x5. And then 5x5 will be into 9x9.

## K-Times zooming

K-times zooming solves the problem of pixel-replication and zero-order zooming. 

**K = zooming factor**

### Working Algorithm

1. First take two adjacent pixels
2. Subtract smaller from larger pixels
3. Result is difference
4. Divide the difference with zooming factor **(K)**
5. Add the output(OP) to smaller value
6. Put the result between two values
7. Add OP to previous result you put & place it next to previous pixel
8. Do till we have (k-1) number of values

Sound Confused? Look Example!

Zooming factor = 3

|       |       |      |       
|-------|-------|------|
| 15     | 30     |15     |
| 30     | 15     |30     | 
|       |       |      | 

First row-wise.

First take two adjacent pixels => 15 & 30

Subtract smaller from larger pixels => 30 - 15 = difference = 15

Divide the difference with zooming factor => 15/3 = 5 = output

Add the result to smaller value => 15 + 5 = 20

Put the result between two values.
Add OP to previous result you put & place it next to previous pixel => 20 + 5 = 25

Now, we have two values : 20,25. We stop here. Because we need (k-1) numbers of values. **k-1=2 (k=3)**

|       |       |      |       |      |       |      |      
|-------|-------|------|-------|------|-------|------|
| 15    | 20    |25    | 30    | 25   |20     |15    |
| 30    |25     |20    | 15    | 20   |25     |30    | 
|       |       |      | 

Then col-wise. Same as row-wise.

Result is 
|       |       |      |       |      |       |      |      
|-------|-------|------|-------|------|-------|------|
| 15    | 20    |25    | 30    | 25   |20     |15    |
|20	    |21	    |21	   |25	   |21	  |21	  |20    |
|25	    |22	    |22    |20	   |22	  |22	  |25    |
| 30    |25     |20    | 15    | 20   |25     |30    | 
|       |       |      | 
```js
[newCols,newRows] = [k(cols-1)+1,k(rows-1)+1]
```

**Pros**

Solve blurry problem of pixel manipulation & 2power problem of zero-order.

**Cons**

It costs a lot of computation power.

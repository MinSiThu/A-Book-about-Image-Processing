# Resolution

We have defined pixel as smallest element of an image. 
The **resolution** can be defined in many ways. Such as pixel resolution, spatial resolution, temporal resolution, spectral resolution.

Now, we are going to focus on pixel resolution.

Computers may have **1024 pixels * 960 pixels**. If an image has **M rows** and **N cols**, then its resolution is **M*N** resolution.

```js
size = resolution * bpp(bits per pixel)
```
# Aspect Ratio

Aspect ratio is the ratio between width of an image and the height of an image. This ratio differs in different images and different screens.
```js
Aspect ratio = cols : rows
```

Most common ratios are

**1.33:1, 1.37:1, 1.43:1, 1.50:1, 1.56:1, 1.66:1, 1.75:1, 1.78:1, 1.85:1, 2.00:1, e.t.c**

Aspect ratio maintains a balance between the appearance of an image on the screen.

For example, we have 1024 rows & 1024 columns. The aspect ratio is 1:1. If we want to make image smaller, reduce to 256 rows and 256 cols, which is same ratio.

### Problem

An gray-scale image with aspect ratio 4:3 has resolution 480000 pixels.

- Resolve pixel resolution to calculate the dimensions of image
- Calculate the size of the image

```js
//Dimensions Calculation

aspect ratio = cols : rows = 4 : 3
resolution =  480000 = cols * rows

cols = 4/3 rows

480000 = 4/3rows * rows
rows^2 = 3/4 *480000

rows = 600 pixels
cols = 800 pixels
```

```js
//Size Calculation
size = resolution * bpp
bpp of gray-scale image = 8

size = 480000 * 8 = 3840000 bits
     = 480000 bytes
     = 468 Kb
```

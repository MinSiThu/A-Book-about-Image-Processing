# Concept of Blurring

An image with a face, looks clear when we are able to identify eyes, ears, nose, lips, forehead e.t.c very clear. This shape of an object is due to its edges. So in blurring, we simple reduce the edge content and makes the transition form one color to the other very smooth.

## Blurring vs Zooming

In zooming, as the zooming factor increase, the blurring will also occurs. This is due to increasing the pixel of the zoomed part, but in blurring, the number of pixels in blurred image and normal image remains the same.

## How to Blur

Blurring can be achieved in many ways. There are three common ways to perform blurring. 

- Mean filter
- Weighted average filter
- Gaussian filter

## Mean Filter

Mean Filter is also known as box blurring and average blurring.

A mean filter has followig properties.
1. It is odd order.
2. Sum of all elements must be 1.
3. All the elements must be same value.
   
3x3 kernel will not blur. As soon as increase the nxn mask, blurring will increase.

## Weighted Average Filter

We will give more weight to center.

Following properties must be in WAF.
- It must be odd ordered
- The sum of all the elements should be 1
- The weight of center element should be more then all of the other elements

||||
|-|-|-|
|1|	1	|1|
|1|	2	|1|
|1|	1	|1|

But second property is not satisfied. In order to solve this, divide the whole matrix by the total of all elements.
Here, dividing factor is 11.
